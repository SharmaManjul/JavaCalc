# JavaCalc
The Calculator was invented in the 1600s but java came around only in the 1990s. This project aims to combine the two 
and create an object-oriented powered calculator. The calculator will be able to perform all the basic computations 
using either passing values in an order or typing it out in natural language, but more importantly the calculations 
under the hood are performed using object-oriented best practices.

##OOP Principles

### Encapsulation
This project implements the concept of encapsulation where classes are used to contain the code and the data it 
manipulates in a single unit. This helps protect our data from the outside world and use **accessors** and **mutators**
to allow the outside world to safely manipulate out data.

### Abstraction

### Inheritance

### Polymorphism

##Java Best Practices

### Constructors
