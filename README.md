# JavaCalc
The Calculator was invented in the 1600s but java came around only in the 1990s. This project aims to combine the two 
and create an object-oriented powered calculator. The calculator will be able to perform all the basic computations 
using either passing values in an order or typing it out in natural language, but more importantly the calculations 
under the hood are performed using object-oriented best practices.
